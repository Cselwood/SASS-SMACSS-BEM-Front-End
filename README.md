# Testing Portfolio Front End Site

My front-end project using SMACSS and BEM, for my portfolio website live at selwood.io

## What is the project?

The barebones beginning of my front-end portfolio site. I'm using SMACSS and BEM methodologies for keeping the CSS architecture clean and I'm picking and choosing typography, JavaScript frameworks, and advanced settings currently. The site is still heavily under-developed, and requires a lot of adjustment.
